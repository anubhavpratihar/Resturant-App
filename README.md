App
This React application represents a basic website structure with multiple pages. It includes a responsive Navbar and a Footer component that are displayed on every page. The pages consist of Home, Menu, About, and Contact, each associated with a specific route using React Router. Users can navigate between pages by clicking on the corresponding links in the Navbar. The styling is managed through the use of the App.css file.
